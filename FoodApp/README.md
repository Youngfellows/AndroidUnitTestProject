## Library and Frameworks
- Minimum SDK level 21
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based, [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous.
- Dagger-Hilt (alpha) for dependency injection.
- JetPack
  - LiveData - notify domain layer data to views.
  - Lifecycle - dispose of observing data when lifecycle state changes.
  - ViewModel - UI related data holder, lifecycle aware.
  - Room Persistence - construct a database using the abstract layer.
- Architecture
  - MVVM Architecture (View - DataBinding - ViewModel - Model)
  - Repository pattern
- [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit) - construct the REST APIs and paging network data.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) - JSON library for Kotlin and Java.
- [coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil)
- [Material-Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android) - Material design components like ripple animation, cardView.

## Code Coverage and Reporting
 - This project uses Jacoco configuration to measure code coverage and currently the most widely used.
 - SonarQube is used for inspecting the Code Quality and Security codebase. 
 - SonarQube consumes Jacoco test coverage report and displays it on [sonarcloud](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=vipulshah2010_FoodApp)

**Run following command from root folder to generate JaCoco reports and view test coverage on** [sonarcloud](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=vipulshah2010_FoodApp)
 ```
./gradlew clean jacocoTestDebugUnitTestReport sonarqube
```

## Planned workflow:
- More unit test coverage
- Instrumentation test coverage
- Fix Shared element transition

## Architecture
FoodApp is based on MVVM architecture and a repository pattern.
